This is a really rudimentary tool to help spark inspiration for designing your own custom MTG cards. 

Please don't look at my code I know how atrocious it is. I just learned Rust like two days I'm getting there. It works and that's what matters. 

You'll need to install rust to run/compile this, please just go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install I'm so tired and don't feel like explaining this. I know why no one just gives people an exe now. 

If you're really desperate, copy the main.rs file into the Playground on the official Rust website. I just checked it and it works.

But once you do get it installed, just clone this repository, open the folder in a terminal, and type "cargo run" and yippee! You're done!
